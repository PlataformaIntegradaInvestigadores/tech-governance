 Guidelines for Project Contribution


## Contributing to a Project

When contributing to an existing project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if necessary).
2. **Branching Strategy**: Since we follow the [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) branching strategy, the main branch is blocked from direct commits. Therefore, you **MUST** create a new branch for every feature, bug fix, refactoring, documentation update, and so on.
3. **Push Changes and Open a Pull Request**: Push your changes to the GitHub repository and open a pull request targeting the `main` or `development` branch. Request a review from at least one reviewer.
4. **Merge Changes**: Once your changes pass all requirements and receive approval, merge them into the `main` or `development` branch. The current branch will be automatically deleted.
5. **Update Local Branch**: Checkout the `main` branch in your local repository and pull the latest changes. For any additional tasks, create a new Asana ticket and follow the steps from point 2.

## Important Recommendations

To streamline development, consider the following recommendations:

- **Frequent Commits**: Push commits regularly, regardless of whether the implementation is complete. This ensures a continuous and collaborative development process.
- **Pull Request**: Open a pull request to the `main` or `development` branch once the task is fully completed and ready for review. This practice helps maintain code quality and collaboration.
